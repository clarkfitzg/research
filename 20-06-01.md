Thinking about what to do for research this summer.
It feels strange to have complete freedom to work on anything, after I've been locked in to my PhD topic for these past few years.

I was thinking about developing a data science textbook, but now I somehow feel unqualified.
That is, I'd like to do more research projects that have challenging large data sets, and contribute more actively to software again, so that I can have more of a robust background to draw on when writing pedagogical materials.
Dessimination is largely how committee members will judge it.
So if it's a text book, and other schools adopt it, that's good.

TODO: 

- Look at academic data science pedagogy
- Write up metaprogramming capabilities in Julia, Python, and maybe other languages
