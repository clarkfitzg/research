## Problem Statement

> In one, concise sentence, state what the problem is in laymen’s terms.
> Make reference to Figure 1 in that sentence.

There are many ways to make a program faster.
Data scientists need to significantly change their R programs to run on different platforms, or to scale up to larger data sets.


Figure 1: (Logos for different technologies)
Some of the platforms available for high performance data processing include Hadoop, GPU’s, multiprocessors, and supercomputers.


## Background

> In a short paragraph, provide background information necessary to help the guest understand the solution.
> Figures may be included here.
> Be sure to make reference to the Figure(s).

Statisticians and data scientists want to analyze more data, faster.
One way to make a program faster is to make it parallel, so many computations happen simultaneously.
The current state of the art requires them to modify their code, sometimes extensively, to make it run efficiently in parallel.
Modifying code for performance makes the code more complicated and less portable, because the modified code must use different specialized programming paradigms.


## Summary of Work

> In this section, explain what you did , what you are doing, or what you plan to do.
> Keep things relatively simple.
> Drawings or pictures are often better than equations.
> Figures may be included here.
> Be sure to make reference to the Figure(s).


## Impact on Community

> What does this mean to the average American or to local industry?
