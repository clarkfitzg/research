# Automatically Scaling Data Analysis Programs

## Problem Statement

> In one, concise sentence, state what the problem is in laymen’s terms.
> Make reference to Figure 1 in that sentence.

It takes too much human labor to modify a data analysis program to efficiently use any particular computing platform.

Some of the platforms available for high performance data processing include Hadoop, GPU’s, multiprocessors, and supercomputers.


## Background

> In a short paragraph, provide background information necessary to help the guest understand the solution.
> Figures may be included here.
> Be sure to make reference to the Figure(s).


Today's parallel platforms allow scientists to analyze more data, faster.
To use these platforms, users must modify their original programs, sometimes extensively.
Modifying code for performance distracts from the original goals of the analysis, and makes the code more complicated and harder to reuse.
Furthermore, a good solution for one particular representation of the data may not work at all if the data format changes.
The most efficient parallel programs are specialized to the particular data set and the platform.


## Summary of Work

> In this section, explain what you did , what you are doing, or what you plan to do.
> Keep things relatively simple.
> Drawings or pictures are often better than equations.
> Figures may be included here.
> Be sure to make reference to the Figure(s).

We developed makeParallel, a system that generates parallel code from serial R code, and tailors the computation to the data set and the platform.
The system analyzes entire scripts holistically, rather than one expression at a time.
Our software design provides a platform for experimentation and further development.
Future work includes generalizing the data description so that it works across multiple languages, such as Python and Julia.



## Impact on Community

> What does this mean to the average American or to local industry? 

- Any R user can apply our software to their R scripts to speed them up.
- Our open source software implementation is available to everyone at https://github.com/clarkfitzg/makeParallel
- This research was supported by NSF GRFP, grant 1650114.
